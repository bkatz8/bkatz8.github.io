                    <p>Before I got anywhere near a pen to start designing or ideating, I took time to break down the prompt into components. I wanted to understand my design objectives and to begin listing the assumptions I carried with me going into the design exercise. I also jotted down notes to keep myself on track during the whole process so that I didn't stray too far off course. Keeping my ideas and research within the projects scale while considering the potential scale of Google were especially important.</p>

These were the things I initially assumed about the users, their behaviors, and their needs. Again, this process was all about rapidly getting a grasp on the scope of the problem and finding where I needed to get more information before moving forward.</p>

                    <p>After getting a general sense of where I wanted to take my design exercise and identifying required research, I decided to dive deeper into the scenarios surrounding the three user groups I indentified while breaking down the design prompt. These user groups were the following- <b>customers/diners, waitstaff, and restaurant management.</b> <br><br>The first step of this process was interviewing user groups to uncover current issues and frustrations, as well as areas of potential opportunity.

This rationale came especially from the in-depth task analysis I did of the the tradtional dining experience.</p>

            <p>With all of my research, initial ideation, user personas and a dissected design prompt, I decided to create a revised design objective. The rationale behind the narrowing of the design prompt was to ensure that the design adressed the needs of all three user groups without distrupting the current flow of the dining experience.<br><br><span style="font-weight:700; font-size:16px; font-style:italic">Design an unobtrusive experience for constructive waitstaff feedback, criticism, and management, centered around the post-meal timeline.</span></p>

                    <p>Below is a higher-level flow for my proposed solution. When a bill is given to a customer with the digital check booklet, they review their check. When they confirm the initial bill, users are prompted to provide feedback about the waitstaff using <b>an extremely short, three-question survey based on the three metrics identified in my research</b> in exchange for an incentive such as a meal discount or survey.<br><br>The data is then sent to cloud storage and shown in the form of data visualization on the management tablet experience. There managers and waitstaff can <b>analyze individual team members' metrics, view overall waitstaff progress, manage incentives, manage checks, and take notes about waitstaff performace.</b></p>
